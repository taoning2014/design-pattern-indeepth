## Design Patterns
> Following quote From _Head First Desgin Pattern_

### How do I use Design Patterns?

We’ve all used off-the-shelf libraries and frameworks. We take them, write some code against their APIs, compile them into our programs, and benefit from a lot of code someone else has written. Think about the Java APIs and all the functionality they give you: network, GUI, IO, etc. Libraries and frameworks go a long way towards a development model where we can just pick and choose components and plug them right in. But... they don’t help us structure our own applications in ways that are easier to understand, more maintainable and flexible. That’s where Design Patterns come in.

Design patterns don’t go directly into your code, they first go into your BRAIN. Once you’ve loaded your brain with a good working knowledge of patterns, you can then start to apply them to your new designs, and rework your old code when you find it’s degrading into an inflexible mess of jungle spaghetti code.
