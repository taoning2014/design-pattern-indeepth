### Composition

Each duck has a FlyBehavior and a QuackBehavior to which it delegates flying and quacking.

When you put two classes together like this youâ€™re using composition. Instead of inheriting their behavior, the ducks get their behavior by being composed with the right behavior object.


### Strategy Pattern Definition

Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.
